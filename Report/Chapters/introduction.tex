The goal of this project is to measure the performance characteristics of a HP's workstation in Opera group when running ubuntu 16.04.4. There is 3 people in our group: Chengcheng, Yihong and Yudong. We finished this system measurement project by C, a typical system implementation languages. Our code is compiled by gcc 5.4.0, with optimization flag \textbf{-O0} by default.

\subsection {Work Division}

All members get involved in the theoretical design and discuss all through the project, and implement parts of the project. For CPU measurement, Yudong did experiments for cycles measurement, measurement code overhead measurements and thread creation,  system call overhead measurements, process context switch measurements; Chengcheng did experiments for loop overhead measurements and task creation measurements; Yihong finished thread context switch measurements. Memory Operation measurements are done by Yudong. Yihong did experiments for networking part. Chengcheng took charge of file system measurements.
